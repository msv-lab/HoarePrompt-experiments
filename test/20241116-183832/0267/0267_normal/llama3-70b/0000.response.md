Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The `count` function correctly calculates the count of numbers with at most $k$ different digits in a given range, and the main function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum modulo $998244353$. The program handles all potential cases and satisfies the problem description for all inputs within the given constraints.
