Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits and prints the result modulo $998244353$. The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to efficiently count the numbers that meet the criteria. The input is correctly read and processed, and the output is calculated and printed as required. The program handles all potential cases and edge cases as described in the problem statement.
