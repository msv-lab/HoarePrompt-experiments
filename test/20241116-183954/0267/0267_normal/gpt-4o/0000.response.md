Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented as described in the problem statement. The program iterates through the numbers in the range $l$ to $r$ and checks if each number satisfies the condition of having at most $k$ different digits. If it does, the number is added to the total sum. The program then returns the total sum modulo $998244353$. The logic seems sound and there are no apparent edge cases where the program would fail to produce the correct result.
