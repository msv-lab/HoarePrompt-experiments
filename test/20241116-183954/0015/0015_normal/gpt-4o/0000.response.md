Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It checks if the favorite number b appears in the sequence correctly by calculating if it can be reached from the first element a with the given difference c. The program handles the cases where b is equal to a, where the difference c is 0, and where b can be reached from a with the given difference c. Therefore, there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description.
