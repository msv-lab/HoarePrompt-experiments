You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You also need to tell me how confident you are in your response from 0 to 100. With 0 being no confident at all and 100 bein 100% sure.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False** , Confidence: **number from 0 to 100**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya likes everything infinite. Now he is studying the properties of a sequence s, such that its first element is equal to a (s_1 = a), and the difference between any two neighbouring elements is equal to c (s_{i} - s_{i} - 1 = c). In particular, Vasya wonders if his favourite integer b appears in this sequence, that is, there exists a positive integer i, such that s_{i} = b. Of course, you are the person he asks for a help.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contain three integers a, b and c ( - 10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9) — the first element of the sequence, Vasya's favorite number and the difference between any two neighbouring elements of the sequence, respectively.


-----Output-----

If b appears in the sequence s print "YES" (without quotes), otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1 7 3

Output
YES

Input
10 10 0

Output
YES

Input
1 -4 5

Output
NO

Input
0 60 50

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the sequence starts from integers 1, 4, 7, so 7 is its element.

In the second sample, the favorite integer of Vasya is equal to the first element of the sequence.

In the third sample all elements of the sequence are greater than Vasya's favorite integer.

In the fourth sample, the sequence starts from 0, 50, 100, and all the following elements are greater than Vasya's favorite integer.
Program:
```
(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
if c == 0:
    if a == b:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
elif (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
Tell me how confident you are in your response in a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 means no confident at all.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False** , Confidence: **number from 0 to 100**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
