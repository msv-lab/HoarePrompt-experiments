Correctness: True, Confidence: 95

Explanation: The program iterates through each character of the alphabet and replaces it in the input string with the next character in alphabetical order. It then checks if the resulting string contains all the characters of the alphabet. If it does, it prints the resulting string, otherwise, it prints -1. The logic seems correct and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The program should work as expected for all inputs.
