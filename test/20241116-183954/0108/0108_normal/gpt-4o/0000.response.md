Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly iterates through the input string and the target string to check if the input string can be transformed into the target string by replacing characters with the next alphabetical character. If it successfully reaches the end of the target string, it prints the target string. If not, it prints -1. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
