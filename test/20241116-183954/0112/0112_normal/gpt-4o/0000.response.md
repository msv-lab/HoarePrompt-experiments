Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by checking if Masha can form all numbers from 1 to x using the given cubes. The logic of the program seems sound and it iterates through all possible numbers to find the maximum x that can be formed. The program also correctly handles the constraints mentioned in the problem description. Additionally, the program uses the itertools.product to generate all possible combinations of cube faces, which is a valid approach to solving the problem. Since the program covers all potential cases and no case has been identified where it does not work as expected, the correctness is deemed to be true with high confidence.
