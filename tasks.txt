#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters n, k, and dp, returning 0 under certain conditions, the value associated with (n, k) from dp, or dp[n, k] when n is less than 10 and k is between 1 and 10.
Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the value associated with the tuple (n, k) from the data structure dp

Case_3: The program returns the value of dp[n, k] where n is less than 10 and k is an integer between 1 and 10.
