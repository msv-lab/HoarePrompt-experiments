def func_1(n):
    return sum(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))
    #The program returns the sum of the cubes of all even integers from 2 to n * 2, where n is a non-negative integer.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter n, a non-negative integer, and returns the sum of the cubes of all even integers from 2 to n * 2.
The program returns the sum of the cubes of all even integers from 2 to n * 2, where n is a non-negative integer.
