def func():
    n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)
    min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))
    sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)
    print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters n, m, k, x, and y, where n and m are positive integers, k is a non-negative integer, and x and y are positive integers within the range of n and m, but the return value is undefined.
