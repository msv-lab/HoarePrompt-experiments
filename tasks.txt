def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)
    return cube_sum
    #The program returns cube_sum which is equal to the sum of the cubes of the first n even numbers
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter n, which is a non-negative integer, and returns the sum of the cubes of the first n even numbers.
The program returns cube_sum which is equal to the sum of the cubes of the first n even numbers
