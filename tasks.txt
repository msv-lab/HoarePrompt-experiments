    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())

    #State: Output State: `t` test cases are processed, and for each test case, the result is printed based on the given formula. The final state of `t`, `n`, `k`, `n_back`, `s`, `m`, and `n` after all iterations will depend on the input values for each test case, but the output will be a series of integers generated from the formula `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes test cases where each test case includes three values: t (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4), n (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of n and k.
