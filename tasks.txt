def func_1(l, r, k):
    dp = {}
    #State of the program here: dp is an empty dictionary
    return (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD
    #State of the program after the return statement: dp is an empty dictionary
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `l, r, and k`, where `l, r, and k` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. After executing the function body, the function returns an empty dictionary `dp`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three integers `l, r, and k` within the specified constraints and return an empty dictionary `dp`.
dp is an empty dictionary
