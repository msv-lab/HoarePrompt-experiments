    return sum
    #The program returns the sum of all combinations `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` in the range from 0 to `n`, where `n` is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer n and returns the sum of all combinations `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` in the range from 0 to `n`.
The program returns the sum of all combinations `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` in the range from 0 to `n`, where `n` is a positive integer.
