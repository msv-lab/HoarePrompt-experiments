#This is the summary for the whole function and its postcondition is : The function accepts two parameters, `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, which are 2×2 grids represented as two lines of strings containing exactly one of each character 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. The function swaps the positions of 'X' in both grids, then returns whether the sorted versions of `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are equal.

    #This is a summary of the total loop and its postcondition is : The input consists of two 2×2 grids (each represented as two lines of strings) where each grid contains exactly one of each character 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. If `i` is initially less than 0, the loop will be executed. If `puzzle1[i]` is 'X', then `x1` is set to `i`. If `puzzle2[i]` is 'X', then `x2` is set to `i`. `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration. The loop will continue until `i` is no longer less than 0. If `i` is initially 0 or greater, the loop will not be executed, and `x1`, `x2`, and `i` will remain unchanged from their initial values.
