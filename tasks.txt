#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two lists, returns a new list containing the elements of the symmetric difference of the input lists, sorted based on their indexes in the combined list.
The program returns a list containing the elements of the symmetric difference of set1 and set2, sorted based on their indexes in the combined list of list1 and list2
