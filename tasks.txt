def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the integer division of the product of a and b by the result of the function func_1(a, b)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, returns the integer division of the product of `a` and `b` by the result of `func_1(a, b)`.
The program returns the integer division of the product of a and b by the result of the function func_1(a, b)
