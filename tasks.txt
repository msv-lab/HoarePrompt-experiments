#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `a`, where `n` is a positive integer and `a` is a list of distinct positive integers. It iterates through the elements of list `a` from the second element onwards, checking if there exists an element `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`. If found, `can_form` is set to True; otherwise, `m` is incremented by 1. The function returns the value of `m`.
