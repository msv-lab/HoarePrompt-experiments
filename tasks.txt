def get_location(apartment):
    block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)
    floor = floor_within_block // k + 1
    return block, floor
    #The program returns the values of block and floor based on the calculations involving n, m, k, a, b, and the derived values of floor_within_block and floor.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter apartment and returns the values of block and floor based on calculations involving the dimensions of the building and the apartment number.
The program returns the values of block and floor based on the calculations involving n, m, k, a, b, and the derived values of floor_within_block and floor.
